Project Description:
This project is intended to act as a functional Hash Table.
The program will read data from a file and use hashing to place the strings from the file into buckets.
The hash function uses the ASCII values of the strings to place them in their respective buckets.
The program also sorts and displays the contents of the hash table in alphabetical and reverse number order based on the number of times the given string ocurred.

Expected Input:
The program expects a file so that it can read the strings from the file.

Expected Output:
The program should first print the strings of the file in alphabetical order.
Then the program should print the strings of the file in reverse numeric order by the number of occurrences.

How to compile: 
To compile and run: make run
